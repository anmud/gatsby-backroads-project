Your adventure begins today with a welcome meeting at 6pm – check with hotel reception to confirm the time. If you can't arrange a flight that will arrive in time, you may wish to arrive a day early. We'll be happy to book additional accommodation for you (subject to availability). "},{"day":"Day 2 (Rabat-Meknes)","info":"Today take an early morning one-hour train to the historical town of Rabat. Rabat's history is long and colourful, having been host to Roman settlements, pirates and more recently the Moroccan parliament. It contains numerous fine Arab monuments, some dating from the 10th to 15th century Almohad and Merenid dynasties, and others that are far older. "},{"day":"Day 3-4 (Volubilis - Fes)","info":"This morning is free to explore Meknes. In the 17th century Sultan Moulay Ismail turned Meknes from a provincial town to a spectacular Imperial city – visit his immense Heri es Souani Granary, a mammoth architectural feat, and the city's now crumbling imperial palaces. Try a camel burger for lunch at friendly local restaurant in the medina."},{"day":"Day 5 (Midelt)","info":"Board the private minibus and leave the intensity of the city behind for the simplicity of the scenic Middle Atlas Mountains (approximately 4 hours). Drive south, inland through a variety of spectacular scenery – fertile valleys, cedar and pine forests and barren, rocky landscapes. The area is populated with wandering nomadic shepherds attending to their flocks."},{"day":"Day 6 (Sahara Camp )","info":"Today it's a five-hour drive towards the mighty Sahara Desert. Since we'll have the convenience of our own private minivan, there will be many opportunities to stop and admire views of Kasbahs and palmeries (valleys lush with date palms, fields and orchards) along the way. Drive through changing scenery, from barren mountainsides to fertile valleys, pausing in frontier towns like Erfoud and Rissani, before reaching the end of the road at the small Saharan settlement of Merzouga."}],"images":[{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/aa6lmvvj10ja/6NSZRwggVNgCBarS1IUNG3/973c9ac53c7dfd45f4abd24a0bfb6198/tour-2.jpeg?w=800&q=50"}},{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/aa6lmvvj10ja/2yc47gSKbixX7EyU7TqbYr/27ae7814b979df923d468a88192a460c/default-3.jpeg?w=800&q=50"}},{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/aa6lmvvj10ja/2chNgX3l7TFq6ec6LJzWHR/a379c76412af7fa13d49593252fc37fc/default-2.jpeg?w=800&q=50"}},{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/aa6lmvvj10ja/1jj61aqGrmYx0M30vPZMW3/b90e67ff01ff6704a08578ca8ee40338/default-1.jpg?w=800&q=50"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"best-of-java"}}}
